# Roblox Game Watcher
 Monitors the updates of Roblox games and sends notifications to a specified Discord channel via a webhook. It checks for game updates by retrieving details from the Roblox Economy API and compares the last update timestamp with the stored timestamp. When an update occurs, a notification is sent, including game details, and the new timestamp is saved.
